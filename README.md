# Interface-Visualization
Â· INTERFACE VISUALIZATION 
Project focuses on capturing live packets from a network, analyzing them , removing the layers and obtaining the final payload in a raw data form (bytes) which is then fit into a template provided by the user such that the raw data is carved into forms like integer or float which can be understood and interpreted by user and are required for certain functions.
The inflow of bytes is taken in a contiguous fashion and then fit into the template in the same manner.
This is done using Packet capture libraries.
User is also provided with a list of interface IDs on a system such that he/she can choose the network they wish to use.
